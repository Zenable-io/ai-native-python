# Reporting Security Issues

Zenable and the ai-native-python community take security seriously, and
appreciate all efforts that disclose concerns responsibly.

If you believe you've found a security bug in our project, please contact us at
[security@zenable.io](mailto:security@zenable.io) and include the words
"ai-native-python vulnerability" in the subject line. If you believe you've
found a security bug in a third-party project used by ai-native-python,
please report it to those maintainers.

Your email will be acknowledged within one business day, and you'll receive a
more detailed response to your email as soon as possible indicating the next
steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and
announcement.
