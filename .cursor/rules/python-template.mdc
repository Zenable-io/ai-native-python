# AI-Native Python Paved Road Template Rules

You are working on a cookiecutter template for generating modern Python projects.

## Critical Context
This is a TEMPLATE GENERATOR. Files in `{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/` contain Jinja2 variables that must be preserved exactly as written.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.13+ with uv package manager (NOT pip/poetry)
- pytest with >80% coverage requirement
- Pre-commit: ruff, pyright, refurb
- Security: grype, syft
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Versioning: CalVer or SemVer-ish

## Code Standards
- Max line length: 120
- Type hints required
- Google-style docstrings
- Use pathlib (no os.path)
- Use logging (no print)
- Specific exception handling

## Key Commands
```bash
task init       # Setup environment
task build      # Build project
task test       # Run tests
task lint       # Check code quality
```

## Template Testing
```bash
uvx cookiecutter .    # Generate project
pytest tests/         # Test template
```
